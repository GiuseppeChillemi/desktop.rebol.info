To test this application using Cheyenne, place the binary in this directory, make it executable and run. It should be run from this directory so as to find the `httpd.cfg`.

Note: the CGI script in `../cgi-bin` should be set up first (in that folder, do `cp desktop.txt desktop.r` and make appropriate edits to settings). Also, the CGI script is not included within the html structure, other web servers allow the placement of the CGI folder outwith the HTTPd folder, but not Cheyenne.
